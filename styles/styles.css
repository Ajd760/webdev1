/* Target classes with . prefix. ID's are targeted with #.
		There should only be unique ID's in the html. 
		Classes can reappear multiple time - hence the name.
		
		you can also target html elements themselves with just the tag. ie. "body" or "h1". this will target every element with that tag, regardless of class or id.
		
		css also reads from top to bottom. So items at the bottom can override items at the top.
